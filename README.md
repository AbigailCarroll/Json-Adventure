# Json-Adventure
An old style text adventure game implemented with c++ and Json files
Made as part of my C++ module during university. Maps are supplied as .json files. There is a .cpp file for accepting the map from the command line "commandlineMain.cpp" and one where the map is hard coded "main.cpp", this is due to the fact that it is much easier to test the different maps by editing the cpp file in visual studio rather than having to re-enter the map name every time I want to run the program.
